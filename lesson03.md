Lesson 3: If statement, Loops, Arrays

---

### Practice solution

```js
let hatPrice = 3.99;
let tShirtPrice = 9.99;

let hatAmount = 2;
let tShirtAmount = 3;

let totalHatPrice = hatAmount * hatPrice;
let totalTShirtPrice = tShirtAmount * tShirtPrice;

let totalCost = totalHatPrice + totalTShirtPrice;

console.log(totalCost);
```

---

## Recap

What did we talk about last lesson?

---

### What does it print?

```js
let name = "Sevtap";
console.log("Hello " + name);
```

Answer: It prints "Hello Sevtap" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### What does it print?

```js
let greeting = "Hello";
let name = "Sevtap";
console.log(greeting + " " + firstName);
```

Answer: Error, "firstName" is not a variable <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### What does it print?

```js
console.log("It is " + temperature + " degrees");
let temperature = 22;
```

Answer: Error, "temperature" is not available <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## If statement

---

### If statement

* Up until now, we wrote code line by line
* But what if we want to conditionally run some JavaScript code?
* Example: I only want to run code if the user is older than 18

---

### If statement

```js
if (condition) {
  // block of code that
  // will run ONLY if
  // condition is true
}
```

---

### Conditional Statements: If statement

```js
if (condition) {
}
```

* `condition` must be a boolean
* The code in the block is _only_ executed if the boolean is `true`
* If the boolean is false, the code block is _not_ executed

---

### Conditional Statements - Examples

```js
if (food === 'pizza') {
  console.log('My favorite!');
}
```

```js
if (money < 1000000) {
  console.log('You are not rich :p');
}
```

```js
if (canSpeakGerman === true) {
  console.log("Guten Tag");
}
```

---

### Code Blocks: {}

* Should be indented for better readability:

```js
if (language === "German") {
  // In VSCode, you can indent code by pressing the "Tab" key,
  // or right-click and choose "Format Document"
  console.log("Guten Tag!");
}
```

---

### Code Blocks: {}

* All variables created in code blocks will disappear after closing the block (technical term: “block scope”)

```js
let name = "John Doe";

if (name === "John Doe") {
  let greeting = "Hi dude";
}
if (name === "Mary Doyle") {
  let greeting = "Hello my dear";
}

console.log(greeting); // ERROR!!!!
```

---

### Code Blocks: {}

* Correct solution:

```js
let name = "John Doe";

let greeting;
if (name === "John Doe") {
  greeting = "Hi dude";
}
if (name === "Mary Doyle") {
  greeting = "Hello my dear";
}

console.log(greeting); // "Hi dude"
```

---

### Quiz

What does it print?

```js
let food = "broccoli";

if (food === "pizza") {
    console.log("yum yum");
}
```

---

### Quiz

What does it print?

```js
let age = 42;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("you are allowed to drive a car");
}
```

---

### Let's code!

Abdullah invented a game where the player with the highest value of his height (in cm) plus five times his age wins

1. Create variables for the heights and ages for you and a person next to you
1. Calculate the score
1. Decide who wins, print the winner and their score to the console. Remember: there can be a draw (both players with the same score).
1. Bonus: Add a third player and write the winner to the console.

---

```js
let myAge = 42;
let myHeight = 160;
let player1Age = 35;
let player1Height = 174;
let myScore = myHeight + (5 * myAge);
let player1Score = player1Height + (5 * player1Age);
if (myScore > player1Score) {
    console.log("I win!");
}
if (myScore === player1Score) {
    console.log("It's a draw!");
}
if (myScore < player1Score) {
    console.log("I lost :(");
}
```

---

### If...Else

![IfElse](images/If-Then-Else-diagram.svg)

```js
if (A) {
  B
} else {
  C
}
```

---

### If...Else example

```js
if (temperature > 25) {
  console.log("Go swimming");
} else {
  console.log("Go biking");
}
```

---

### If...Else-If...Else example

```js
if (day === 'Saturday') {
  console.log('Do all the shopping.');
} else if (day === 'Sunday') {
  console.log('Relax!');
} else {
  console.log('Wake up and go to work!');
}
```

---

### Exercise

<!-- .slide: style="font-size:80%" -->

* Make three if statements
  * Make a "Good day" greeting if the hour is less than 18
  * Make a statement that only says “Hello” to someone with your name.
  * Make a statement that prints "I am younger" if your age is less than your neighbor's
* Describe the weather based on the temperature:
  * Above 30
  * Above 20
  * Above 5
  * Everything else

---

### Is this correct?

```js
let temperature = 7;

if (temperature > 20) {
  console.log("it's warm");
} else if (temperature > 30) {
  console.log("too hot!!!");
} else if (temperature > 5) {
  console.log("perfect.");
} else {
  console.log("it's a bit chilly.")
}
```

Try with a temperature of 35, what does it print? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Correct solution

```js
let temperature = 35;

if (temperature > 30) {
  console.log("too hot!!!");
} else if (temperature > 20) {
  console.log("it's warm");
} else if (temperature > 5) {
  console.log("perfect.");
} else {
  console.log("it's a bit chilly.")
}
```

<!-- .slide: id="lesson6:loops" -->

## Loops

---

### Loops

![loops](images/loop_js-02-farm.png)

<!-- from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code -->

---

### While loop

A `while` loop repeats its body while its `condition` is `true`:

```js
while (condition) {
  // body is executed while "condition" is true
  console.log("Hello from while loop");
}
```

Example:

```js
while (isHungry) {
  eat();
}
```

While `isHungry` is `true`, the function `eat` is called.

---

### While loop 2

A while loop might execute zero to unlimited times:

```js
let isHungry = false; // we just ate
while (isHungry) {
  eat(); // this is never reached!
}
```

---

### While loop 3

Always make sure that a `while` loop's condition is eventually set to `false`:

```js
while (true) {
  console.log("Hello");
  // this code will print "Hello" until your laptop
  // runs out of battery, you kill the process
  // by closing the browser, you reboot or the universe ends
}

while (isHungry) {
  goRunning(); // going running makes us more hungry
               // loop won't terminate!!!
}
```

---

### Counting

Quiz: Let's `console.log` the numbers from 1 to 5 using a `while` loop.

---

### Counting - solution

Quiz: Let's `console.log` the numbers from 1 to 5 using a `while` loop.

```js
let i = 1;          // initialize i with 1
while (i < 6) {     // repeat this loop until we reach 6
  console.log(i);
  i++;              // increment i at every step
}
```

---

### Quiz

What will this loop output?

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 2) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

Answer: 0, until you run out of battery<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Quiz

* How many times will the loop run?

```js
let i = 10;
while (i < 15) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

Answer: 5<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Exercises

* Output your name five times
* Output the squares of the first 10 numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, ...)
* Output the sum of the first 10 numbers

---

### For loops - parts

Remember this? Let's divide it in parts

```js
let i = 1;          // part 1 - initialize the counter
while (i < 6) {     // part 2 - the exit condition
  console.log(i);
  i++;              // part 3 - update the counter
}
```

You can see that all three parts are spread around.
If the body of the `while` loop gets more complex, it
might be difficult to figure out how long the while loop
runs.

---

### For loops

How can we express the three parts of our while loop better?

We can use a for loop:

```js
for (init; test; update) {
  // body
}
```

The `for` loop consists of three parts, separated by semicolon (`;`)

---

### For loop

Let's replace our `while` loop with a `for`:

```js
let i = 1;          // part 1 - initialize the counter
while (i < 6) {     // part 2 - the exit condition
  console.log(i);
  i++;              // part 3 - update the counter
}

// same code with for loop:

for (let i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

---

### For loop - summary

* A `while` loop executes its body while the condition is `true`.
* A `for` loop *first* runs the **init** part, checks the **condition** part
and if it is `true`, executes the body. After every loop, it executes the **update** part.

---

### For vs. while

* We use a `for` loop if we know in advance how often it will be executed.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { console.log(i); }
```

* We use a `while` loop if we don't know how many times the loop will be executed.

```js
while (emailIsWrong) { askForEmail(); }
```

---

### Exercises

* Draw a pyramid to console:

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```
* BONUS: Count down from 10 to 0 and output it on console.
* BONUS: Solve chapter 2 of http://roverjs.com/

---

### Further Practice

This is a real interview question for a Junior JavaScript developer:

* Print all the numbers from 1 to 100 to console
  * If the number is divisible by 3, print “Fizz” instead
  * If the number is divisible by 5 (and not by 3), print “Buzz” instead
  * If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz” instead

Hint: Check the Reminder Operator in lesson 2.

<!-- .slide: id="lesson7:arrays" -->

### Arrays

Array is a container type that holds multiple values:

```js
let cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// we create an array using []
let emptyArray = [];

// we put the values we want in square brackets
// separated by commas
let ages = [19, 33, 25, 40];
```

---

Array can hold any type of value:

```js
let prices = [0.99, 1.49];
```

And any quantity:
```js
// I only have one favorite food
let favoriteFoods = ["Pizza"];
// An array holding 26 letters of the alphabet
let alphabet = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l"]; //TODO
```

---

### Analogy: Bookshelf

A bookshelf represents an array of books

![bookshelf](images/bookshelf.jpg)

```js
let books = ["Harry Potter", "The Hobbit", "Game of Thrones"];
```

---

### Accessing elements

We can access elements in the array by number using square brackets "`[]`"

The numbering starts at `0` (think floors of a building):

```js
let books = ["Harry Potter", "The Hobbit", "Game of Thrones"];

console.log(books[0]); // "Harry Potter"
console.log(books[1]); // "The Hobbit"
// QUIZ - how do we access "Game of Thrones" ?
```

```js
console.log(books[2]); // "Game of Thrones"
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
The order of elements in the array matter!
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


---

### Bookshelf array

![bookshelf](images/array_bookshelf_0.png)

---

### Invalid elements

```js
let books = ["Harry Potter", "The Hobbit", "Game of Thrones"];

console.log(books[0]); // "Harry Potter"
console.log(books[1]); // "The Hobbit"
console.log(books[2]); // "Game of Thrones"
console.log(books[3]); // ???
```

```js
console.log(books[3]); // undefined
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Quiz

```js
let friends = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"];

console.log(friends[1]); // ???
console.log(friends[3]); // ???
```

```js
console.log(friends[1]); // "Bob"
console.log(friends[3]); // undefined
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Exercise 1

* Step 1: Create an array with your 3 top friends (or foes)
* Step 2: Say "hello" on console to each friend, e.g.:

```
hello Alice
hello Bob
hello Carol
```

---

### Modifying arrays

We can change any value using brackets:

```js
let friends = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"];

friends[1] = "David";

console.log(friends[1]); // "David"
```

---

### Common operations: array length

We can get the length of an array with the `.length` property:

```js
let friends = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"];
console.log(friends.length); // 3
```

---

### Iterating through an array

We can use loops to go through elements of an array.

```js
let cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
    let currentCar = cars[i];
    console.log(currentCar);
}
```

---

### Array destructuring

Destructuring means to break down a complex structure into simpler parts. With the syntax of destructuring, you can extract smaller fragments from objects and arrays. It can be used for assignments and declaration of a variable.

## Example

```js
var arr = ["Hello", "World"]  
  
// destructuring assignment  
var [first, second] = arr;  
  
console.log(first); // Hello  
console.log(second); // World  
```

---

## Example 2

```js
var colors = ["Violet", "Indigo", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow", "Orange", "Red"];  
  
// destructuring assignment  
var[color1, color2, color3] = colors;  
  
console.log(color1); // Violet  
console.log(color2); // Indigo  
console.log(color3); // Blue  
```

---

If you want to choose random elements from the given array then in array destructuring you can perform it as follows:

```js
var colors = ["Violet", "Indigo", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow", "Orange", "Red"];  
  
// destructuring assignment  
var[color1, ,color3, ,color5] = colors; //Leave space for unpick elements  
console.log(color1); // Violet  
console.log(color3); // Blue  
console.log(color5); // Yellow   
```

In the above example, we have defined an array named colors which has seven elements. But we have to show three random colors from the given array that are Violet, Blue, and Yellow. These array elements are in positions 0, 2, and 4.

During destructuring, you have to leave the space for unpick elements, as shown in the above example. Otherwise, you will get unintended results.

---

### Exercise 2

* Step 1: Create an array with your 3 top friends (you can use the same from exercise 1)
* Step 2: Say "hello" on console to each friend, using a `for` loop!

```
hello Alice
hello Bob
hello Carol
```

---

### Appending new values

We can append new values to an array using `.push()`:

```js
let friends = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"];
console.log(friends.length); // 3

friends.push("David");

console.log(friends.length); // 4
console.log(friends[3]); // David
```

---

### Exercise 3

Create an array containing a few numbers, ex `[3, 2, 9, 5, 6]`

* Output the last element of your array
* Output the sum of all the numbers in the array
* Output the largest number of the array
* Output the average (mean) of all numbers (sum of all numbers divided by amount of numbers)

---

### Bonus Exercise

* Create a new array containing only numbers of the original array that are smaller than 5
 * ex: given input `[1, 3, 7, 2, 9, 5]`, return `[1, 3, 2]`
* Write a function that takes a number and an array of numbers as input parameter. Return the index of the number if it is in the array, otherwise return `-1`
 * ex: given inputs `5` and `[2, 1, 5, 6, 3]`, return `2`
