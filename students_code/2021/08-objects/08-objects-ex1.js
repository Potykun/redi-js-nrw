// You have written a program that tells you how likely it is to rain outside (in percent %).

// Unfortunately, it is not very accurate, it sometimes gives you more than 100% or less that 0%.

// These are the values you got:

//                  [55.1, 45.6, 145.01, 10, -0.5, 0.001, 110, -0.001]

// -> Write some code that replaces all values less than 0 with 0, and bigger than 100 with 100.
